# markov
A markov-chain generator.
Place a plain text file into the directory specified in the config; then run using the dotnet sdk.
Uses `.NET 6.0`.
When I bother to make the implementation, it will cache prior results in the directory of the text list, meaning that for each run with the same list, the generations get faster and faster.

## Examples
These examples were generated using 10 words and the test_list.
They are "emotional" quotes.

```txt
Take up and within us are dirty, the people you strong.
```
```txt
Don't settle. As you up everything around us becomes better person.
```
